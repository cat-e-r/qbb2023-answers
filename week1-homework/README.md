EXERCISE 2.2
What is the “size” of this relationship? In your own words, what does this mean? Does this match what you observed in your plots in step 2.1?
    As age increases by one year the mother passes on 0.3776 times as many de novo mutations. This matches what I observed in step 2.1 where with the mother's age de novo mutations increased, but not super quickly.


Is this relationship significant? How do you know?
    Yes, because the p-value is pretty close to 0 meaning we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the mother's age and the number of de novo mutations.

EXERCISE 2.3
What is the “size” of this relationship? In your own words, what does this mean? Does this match what you observed in your plots in step 2.1?
    As age increases by one year the father passes on 1.35 times as many de novo mutations. This matches what I observed in step 2.1 where with the father's age de novo mutations increase more quickly than in the case of the mother's age.


Is this relationship significant? How do you know?
    Yes, because the p-value is pretty close to 0 meaning we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the father's age and the number of de novo mutations.

EXERCISE 2.4
Using your results from step 2.3, predict the number of paternal DNMs for a proband with a father who was 50.5 years old at the proband’s time of birth. Record your answer and your work (i.e. how you got to that answer) in your README.md.

    y = (1.3538)(50.5) + 10.3263 = 78.6932

EXERCISE 2.6
What statistical test did you choose? Why?
    I used a ttest to compare the means of each group, maternal and paternal, to see how different they are.

Was your test result statistically significant? Interpret your result as it relates to the number of paternally and maternally inherited DNMs.
    Yes, the result is statistically significant, because the p-value is very close to 0. This means that the probands experienced significantly fewer paternal de novo mutations.
