Step 2
What fraction of peaks were retained when intersected compared to sample1? 0.8636 

Sample2? 0.8351

Step 3
How reproducible are the peaks called between the two samples? Is the p-value range of a peak indicative of reproducibility? Is it completely consistent?
 - The peaks look pretty similar suggesting that this fraction of the chromosome represents the whole genome well
 - Yes, because the p-values are higher when the sequences overlap more
 - No, not completely because there are some places where the sequences don't overlap well, but the p-value is high-ish.
