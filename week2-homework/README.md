Step 1.1
1Mbp * 3X = 3Mbp
3Mbp/100bp = 30000 reads

Step 1.3
4.9043% of the genome has not been sequenced.
This matches the Poisson distribution very well.
The normal distribution fits, but not as well.

Step 1.4
0.011% of the genome has not been sequenced.
Both the poisson and normal distributions fit pretty well, but poisson still fits slightly better.

Step 1.5
0.003% of the genome has not been sequenced.
Both poisson and normal distributions fit well.

Step 2.5
TTA TAT ATT TTC TCA CAT ATT TTG TGA GAT ATT TTC TCT CTT

Step 2.6
How many times is each trimer repeated?
How long is the total sequence?
Where does the sequence start in the loop?

Step 3.1
Prompt: Write a 3 paragraph essay about why developmental biologists should use genomics with citations

Chat GPT: Developmental biology is a field dedicated to unraveling the intricate processes that drive an organism's growth and development from a single fertilized cell to a complex, multicellular organism. Over the years, technological advancements have revolutionized the way developmental biologists conduct their research, with genomics emerging as a crucial tool in their arsenal. Genomics, the study of an organism's entire genetic makeup, offers a comprehensive and holistic approach to understanding the genetic underpinnings of development. This essay explores the reasons why developmental biologists should incorporate genomics into their research, with a focus on its ability to provide a global view of gene regulation and its potential to uncover novel insights into the mechanisms governing development.

First and foremost, genomics provides developmental biologists with a global perspective on gene regulation. Unlike traditional molecular biology techniques that focus on a single gene or pathway, genomics allows researchers to analyze the entire genome of an organism. This comprehensive approach enables scientists to identify all the genes that are active during a particular developmental process, as well as their interactions and regulatory networks. For instance, techniques such as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) can reveal the entire transcriptome of a developing organism, shedding light on which genes are turned on or off at specific stages of development. This global view of gene expression patterns is invaluable for understanding the complex choreography of gene regulation that orchestrates development.

Furthermore, genomics has the potential to uncover novel insights into the mechanisms governing development. By comparing the genomes of different organisms or studying genetic variations within a species, developmental biologists can identify key genes and regulatory elements that play critical roles in development. For instance, comparative genomics has revealed evolutionarily conserved genes and pathways that are essential for development across species, highlighting the fundamental principles underlying development. Additionally, genomics can identify genetic mutations associated with developmental disorders, providing critical information for diagnosing and potentially treating these conditions. By leveraging genomics, developmental biologists can unlock new avenues for research and translational applications.

In conclusion, the integration of genomics into developmental biology research is essential for several compelling reasons. Genomics provides a global view of gene regulation, allowing researchers to understand the intricate genetic networks that drive development. Moreover, genomics has the potential to uncover novel insights into the mechanisms governing development and offers valuable tools for diagnosing and potentially treating developmental disorders. As technology continues to advance, developmental biologists should embrace genomics as an indispensable tool in their quest to unravel the mysteries of growth and development.

(NOTICE THERE ARE NO CITATIONS... So I followed up on this)

Promt: can you add references to this essay?

Chat GPT: I apologize for any confusion, but as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, I don't have direct access to external sources such as specific reference databases or the internet to provide up-to-date citations. However, I can suggest some general references and sources that you can use to support the points made in the essay. Please verify the most recent and relevant sources for your specific needs:

Genomics and Global Gene Regulation:

When incorporating references, be sure to follow the citation style required by your institution or publication. Additionally, consider consulting more recent sources and peer-reviewed articles to ensure the accuracy and currency of your essay's references.

Step 3.2
The essay is pretty good!!
I did have to prompt a second time for references.
There is one reference that I'm not finding on Google.. so it seems like it may not exist (Bashmad, M. J., & Nickerson, D. A. (1996)...). I proceeded by asking if it was real and it responded with this:
"I apologize for the confusion, but it seems there was an error in my previous response. The reference "Bamshad, M. J., & Nickerson, D. A. (1996)" does not appear to be a real or valid reference. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

If you're looking for references related to genetics and genomics of developmental disorders, you may want to explore more recent and authoritative sources in the field through academic databases or libraries. Reliable sources for such information can include peer-reviewed journals, textbooks, and research articles in the field of genetics and developmental biology."
So.. Chat GPT admits it.. but why did it give me the reference in the first place??
Chat GPT: "I apologize for the inclusion of the erroneous reference in my previous response. That was not my intention, and I regret any confusion it may have caused. My aim is to provide accurate and helpful information, and I appreciate your feedback in pointing out the mistake. Please feel free to ask any further questions or seek assistance with any topic, and I'll do my best to provide accurate and reliable information."
ANYWHO
I also think the essay ends on too strong of a note. It says "In conclusion, the integration of genomics into developmental biology research is essential for several compelling reasons." The word ESSENTIAL is a bit stronger than what I would have used.. but perhaps that's the scientist in me shying away from too certain of a statement. It's also not what I asked for Chat GPT to argue.
However, the points the essay makes are really quite good!
