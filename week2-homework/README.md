Step 1.1
1Mbp * 3X = 3Mbp
3Mbp/100bp = 30000 reads

Step 1.3
4.9043% of the genome has not been sequenced.
This matches the Poisson distribution very well.
The normal distribution fits, but not as well.

Step 1.4
0.011% of the genome has not been sequenced.
Both the poisson and normal distributions fit pretty well, but poisson still fits slightly better.

Step 1.5
0.003% of the genome has not been sequenced.
Both poisson and normal distributions fit well.
